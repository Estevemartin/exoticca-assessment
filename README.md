# Exoticca (Adiona) Technical Assessment

This technical assessment has been developed by Esteve Martín.

## Objectives

Create a Data Table that allows:

  :white_check_mark: Create Entities

  :white_check_mark: Delete Entities

  :white_check_mark: Filter Data by "Post Title" and "Post Description"

  :white_check_mark: Use Pagination in the Table

  :white_check_mark: Edit Entities (Bonus)

  :white_check_mark: Create Tests for the Application (Bonus)

## Considerations

:one: I had never worked with <b>React-Query</b> before. Everything has been learned in the last 24h so I'm sure that there's plenty of room for improvement.

:two: The same happens with <b>React-Testing-Library</b>. Even though it's pretty similar to Jest (which I'm more used to work with), I'm sure there's many things that can be improved.

:three: (the most important:triangular_flag_on_post:) If finally you want me to join Exoticca, I would have time to learn and become an expert in <b>React-Query</b> and <b>React-Testing-Library</b> before the work starts, but in 24h that's what I have been able to learn :D

## Points for Improvement

- React-Query Mutations make components rerender making the aplication a bit slower when you write on an input field for example.
- The side bar should be more responsive. It should hide for smaller screens and a burger icon should be used to open and close the menu.
- Inline Styles should be removed. Classes should be managed better with styled components and themes. 
- A dark mode should be created. Since I assume that's why the "moon" icon in the navbar is for.
- More tests should be developed. Modals, toasts and other elements should be tested.

## :thumbsup: Final Message

Thank you Matej and Alejandro for this opportunity. I have had the chance of learning a bit about React-Query and React-Testing-Library thanks to this assessment. 

I would really like to be able to become part of Exoticca and I'm more than willing to learn and improve in any way you think I should after reviewing this assessment.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Esteve Martín
